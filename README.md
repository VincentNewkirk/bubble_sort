Bubble Sort Explanation:
On each pass through the array it will check the current number and compare it to the next number. If the next number is less than the current number, they switch places. It will keep doing this as it passes through the array and will stop when it can pass through the array without switching any numbers.

Best Case Scenario:
When the numbers in the array are already ordered from smallest to largest. The algorithm would only pass through the array once and be completed.

Worst Case Scenario:
When the numbers in the array are ordered largest to smallest. The algorithm would have to pass through the array the maxinum amount of times
